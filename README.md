# E2EE API

## Description

This is a skeleton for an end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) API. It provides a basic structure for building secure communication channels between clients, ensuring that data is encrypted on the sender's device and can only be decrypted on the recipient's device. The goal is to use this API with a react-native front-end using the libsignal library (Signal protocol).
